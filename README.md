##### Millionaire Madness

##### The first line contains two integers: the length M, and the width N of the vault, satisfying M >= 1, N <= 1000. The following M lines each contain N integers. Each integer specifies the height of the pile of coins in the vault at the corresponding position. (The first line describes the north-most stacks from west to east; the last line describes the south-most stacks from west to east). The heights are given in meters and all heights are at least 0 and at most 10^9.

##### Output a single line containing a single integer: the length in meters of the shortest ladder that allows you to get from the north west corner to the south east corner.
